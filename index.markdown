<!-- # About me -->

Hi, Welcome to my personal website!

I am a computer vision master's student at CTU in Prague, Czech Republic.
I am interested in computer vision and machine learning in general and I have been working in 
the Visual Recognition Group since the very start of my university studies. This site will mostly feature news
and posts about my research and other activities.
