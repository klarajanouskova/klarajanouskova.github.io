Hi!

<img src="/doc/current.jpg" width="200" style="float: right;" />
<!-- ![profile photo]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/current.jpeg =100x;") -->

I am a computer vision master's student at CTU in Prague, Czech Republic.
I am interested in computer vision and machine learning in general and I have been working at the Visual Recognition Group at my univesity, supervised by professor Jiri Matas.

My research mostly focuses on learning with limited supervision, currently image segmentation. Previously, I worked on scene-text detection and recognition and other document-analysis related topics.

Currently, I am in Haifa, doing an intenrship at the Technion with Chaim Baskin.

Previously, I interned at IBM Research Zurich and the CVC at UAB.
